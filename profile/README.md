# Introduction

The name is inspired by the "We have food at home" meme as it's supposed to be a fun and experimental tool to eliminate context switch as well as copy/pasting code between vscode and chatgpt in browser while keeping the experience free of cost. It doesn't aim to be an actual copilot alternative.

Get started by learning more about and installing:

1. [Chromium Extension](https://github.com/copilot-at-home/chromium-extension)
